# Fraud-Transactions-Data-Analysis-Project-via-Python-

This is an ongoing personal project. 

Coding language is python, and all of the coding is done in Jupyter Notebook. An easy to use platform, most of you have heard of! 

I am in the stages of writing python code to understand the data (100 rows) and what it consists of. 

In the beginning stages of this personal project, I have had to clean the data and format the data using excel. 

Making sure there were no null values, and if there were, adjust accordingly. 

Formatting the date/time/amount/serial numbers in proper format for each of the 100 transactions. 

I will keep updating this note, to keep you all informed.


Goal of this project is to land an entry level data analyst position! Of course, feedback is welcomed! 

Update 3.23.24 - Finally solved the problem of converting dtypes for a certain to another dtype. 
                 ex. trying to convert 'amt' column from object to float64 dtype. 
                 This was an obstacle for quite a while, but solved.
